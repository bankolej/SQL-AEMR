This project analyzes outage data from the American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) to address two key concerns:

A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability

The analysis leverages SQL to extract insights from the AEMR_Outage_Table, focusing on outage types, frequency, duration, and impact across the 2016 and 2017 calendar years.

 Tools Used
SQL (Jupyter Notebook / DB Browser / PostgreSQL)
Excel (for initial review, if needed)

Key Insights
Outage trends by type and year
Peak periods for each outage type
High-impact providers
Potential areas for improved reliability
 Additional Notes
This project may include visualizations or extended findings that go beyond the initial business concerns to provide deeper strategic insights for AEMR leadership.
